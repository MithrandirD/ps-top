New features
------------

Some thoughts for new features which I hope to get around to.
See also BUGS which probably need fixing first.

1. performance_schema has several tables showing a wide variety of
interesting information. So look and see which tables are most
interesting and adapt pstop to show this.

2. Often we want to look at behaviour over time when we change
something, so cumulative statistics are not idea: we'd like to see
a window of data which gradually moves over time. Look at how to
implement this with ps_top.  I'd expect the window to be rather
small, perhaps 1 minute, or maybe longer triggered by collecting
data less frequently.

3. vmstat, iostat, pt-diskstats and other such utilities show values
over time but providing output as stdout. It might be useful to
have options to pstop to present the info in that sort of format
too.

4. add some replication metrics to pstop as most of my servers are
slaves and we want to know where the server is busy. I've seen a
way to do that and need to incorporate it into pstop.

5. _if_ ps statistics get truncated it would be good to be able
to remember the latest state and add those metrics back again, _if_
looking at absolute rather than statistics. I currently truncate
info after 15-minutes, so this might happen while watching a server
with pstop.

6. Improve the options for sorting the data. Total latency is good,
but it would be good to see the write based metrics ordered by total
write latency. So look to improve the display and sort options here.

7. Add command line options for providing access to the MySQL server.
Currently uses ~/.my.cnf and that's all.

8. shift-tab to go back a screen.

Issue 3 - termbox - SHIFT + TAB with go - termbox library ...
code.google.com/p/termbox/issues/detail?id=3
14 Sep 2010 - If I press Shift + Tab the Poll function will send
me 3 things successively: 1: Key 27 2: Ch 91 3: Ch 90 It's the only
Key I know that do that.
