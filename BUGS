Bugs

See also NEW_FEATURES for things which probably need adding soon.

1. Show the binlogs completely and match them properly
by looking at the pattern defined in the server. Currently I'm using
hard-coded stuff which matches personal usage.

2. Latency issues over slow connections. Perhaps I should use
compressed connection to speed things up, but that is not possible
at the moment. See https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/issues/24
for more details.
