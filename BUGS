Bugs

See also NEW_FEATURES for things which probably need adding soon.

1. Show the binlogs completely and match them properly
by looking at the pattern defined in the server. Currently I'm using
hard-coded stuff which matches personal usage.

2. Latency issues over slow connections. Perhaps I should use
compressed connection to speed things up, but that is not possible
at the moment. See https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/issues/24
for more details.

3. Sometimes I see this:

pstop 0.0.12 -  8:46:41 xxxxxxxxxxxxx / 5.6.21-log, up 1d 22h 59m 16s   [ABS]
Latency by Table Name (table_io_waits_summary_by_table) 239 rows

with a very long latency. Related to doing backups. Need to check the cause
of the 5124.10h ++ issue. Probably a subtraction problem of some sort.

4. Mutex page needs to configure P_S and restore confiuration on exit.

This is: set the appropriate settings such as

UPDATE setup_instruments
SET enabled = 'YES', timed = 'YES'
WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/synch/mutex/innodb/%';

However, on exit, it should restore the previous settings back to
what they were before.  Currently if you've not set p_s appropriately you
won't get any useful information out of this page.
