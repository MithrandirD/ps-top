See also NEW_FEATURES for things which probably need adding soon. 

1. Show the binlogs completely and match them properly
by looking at the pattern defined in the server. Currently I'm using
hard-coded stuff which matches personal usage.

2. Only tested on MySQL 5.6 and MariaDB 10.0. It should be possible
to make this work on MySQL 5.7 but that has not been tested yet.
